## Dental Clinic
Dental Clinic is a project for managing patients in a dental clinic.
The views that can be found in this project are:
### Our patients
- Shows each patient existing in the database with part of their information. It also brings an option to "See More" information for each one, "Update" a patient and "Delete" one.
- It has a search field to search for the patient we want.
### Add patient
- Allows us to create a patient once the form is completed. The required data are name, last name, document, phone number, birth date and observations. You can also upload an image of a last x-ray of the patient. If the form is valid, once submitted it is redirected to the page where all existing patients (including the newly created one) are listed.
### View profile
- When we click on the user's name, a view with the user's information is displayed. You have two options, one to edit the user's data (where they can add an avatar if they wish) and another to change the password.
### Logout
- When a user wants to log out, they can click here.
### Login
- Any registered user can log in with their username and password.
### Register
- A user can be created if the form is completed correctly.
### About Me
- Is a view where some information about the page's creator (me) is detail.
